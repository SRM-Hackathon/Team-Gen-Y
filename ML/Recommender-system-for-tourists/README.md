# Recommender-system-for-tourists

I would like to thank Maithrey Talware for his repository where he worked with the toronto, canada for the recommmendation system POC.
Here is the repo, https://github.com/maitreytalware/Recommender-system-for-tourists.
In our Personalized Iternary Tourist Companion, TRAVERSE, we have come up with personalized choices of a tourist based on what he wants to visit in a place like monuments, museums etc.and the choices are rhe key attributes of the created dataset, based on whose features overall ratings are given. With this the tourist has not to put much efforts.
We have created a dummy due to lack of data.

## Concept
### Data extractrion, imputation and vizualizations
### One hot encoding of required features
### content based filtering
### collaboration based filtering
### display of tourist spots based on likeliness
We have used knn algorithm for model training
